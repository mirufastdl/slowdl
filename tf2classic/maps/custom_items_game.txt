//
//	Welcome to the New-Old Weapons Pack!
//			| VERSION 2.7.5 |
// By Scout's Headset / SilentFox3 / Kiri
//					-
//			(For TF2C v2.1.2)
//--------------------------------------//
//
// Heya! Welcome to the main file (or, one of them) for the New-Old Weapons Pack!
//
// This file is the main meat of this mod - this is the bit that actually adds all the weapons to the game. 
// The rest of this mod's content you see in the .vpks and etc is mostly set dressing, but this all is important!
//
// I won't go too in-depth on how to format a new entry for a new weapon (you can look over the included tutorial for that!)
// HOWEVER, I'll have left many, MANY notations about aspects of weapon types, a specific weapon, or the process of making one of these weapons as Code Comments (like you can see below)
// If you've got the time, and are interesting in learning how these Weapons tick, and the process that went into them - I encourage reading through!
//
// Stuff is ordered in the general order I made them, if you need reference to when I made stuff.
// Walk in with an open mind, and hopefully you'll learn a lot!
//
//--------------------------------------//
//
// Personally, I think it's best for the folks of you that wish to make a weapon or weapons of their own to look through this, pick things up, and learn by doing it yourselves.
// I think earnestly each and every one of you could surely learn more from doing yourself than by asking me questions about it.
//
// Use Live TF2's and TF2C's default items_game.txt, my Attributes Listing and Items_Game Tutorial a few folders back, Google / Valve Developer Community Wiki searching, and your own intuition.
// Source is an old engine. No doubt, someone has asked the same kind of questions you've had - and had them answered. Broaden your search range - you can find help in unusual places.
//
// You can find the answer to your TF2 / TF2C questions in old posts about DOD:S or CSS. You can find engine tips from the depth of HL2 modding, or even sometimes Quake discussion. Hell, even esoteric file type might be used more commonly in other games, like Sonic Generations or PSO2.
// This was all to say, don't limit yourself to just TF2, and the answers will flow in as you search for them.
//
//
// Search, problem-solve, hypothesize on problems and test solutions for them. These are valuable life skills that you really can apply anywhere - even making new funny weapons for a TF2 Sourcemod.
// People might not always be around to help you in person, so take it into your own hands if you want something done, and something done well.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------// For some sense of convenience, I'll try to keep my weapons up in the 3300-4500 ID range. Higher than that, I won't touch - feel free to use those for your own stuff!
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// FUNCTIONALLY though, I should only need like, 3300-4000. 8+ Updates later, and I've only barely scratched up to using maybe 300 total. Still, from now on, I'll do my best to keep in this range. You have my word.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// I'm unsure how other Weapons Packs want to handle it, but having all of our stuff cordoned off into copy-and-pasteable chunks might help quite a bit!
//-- NEW-OLD WEAPONS PACK ITEMS AREA (3300 - 4500)-------------------//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Also, if you're wondering why such a specific number; TF2C v2.0.0 Release had its unlockable items all the way up at about the 3000 range. I figured I'd start mine at 3300 to be safe.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// That's enough for the 10 classes to get 10 official weapons in EVERY weapon slot, including PDAs! Needless to say, that's far more than even Live TF2 ever had (not counting reskins).
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Granted, later they reverted to having the new items be in the low 32-50's range, so that left a huge amount of space in-between. I'm not moving my weapons closer, so if you want anything that shows up BEFORE my stuff - try there!

//----------------------
//---------------------- This belonged to a weapon that I was testing for a fairly long time and was ALMOST confident in releasing, the Helicopter Gun. However, things didn't pan out... this entry's empty until I can figure something out.
//--EMPTY ENTRY - 3496-- The basic gist, was that it applied very weak pushback force onto Heavy to allow him to hover in the air if he shoots directly downward. Offset by extremely low ammo, low dps, and extra fall damage (don't sleep on this it HURTS)
//---------------------- However, despite my best efforts, there was too much weirdness with all sorts of things like explosives, Jump Pads, and even -water- making Heavy skyrocket into the Skybox. This wasn't something I think people would stomach dealing with...
//----------------------

// Empty, for the time being!
